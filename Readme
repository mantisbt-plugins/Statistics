Version 1.0.3 Available for mantis 2.x

The Statistics plugin presents statistical overviews in graphics and/or table lay-out of your Mantis installation.

This plugin is based upon MantisStats|Lite as created by Avetis Avagyan (www.MantisStats.org). I have tried to get in touch with him but did not succeed. also the website does not exist anymore. The original plugin was using non open source software, most likely the reason why it was abandoned.

In this plugin I have replaced the proprietary software with true open source software. Fusioncharts (www.fusioncharts.com) fully replaced by the free jpGraph software, version 4.4.2 (www.jpgraph.net). Datatables (https://datatables.net/) java script has been updated to latest version(1.13.8).

Now fully compliant with Mantis 2.26
